[Where the F*** is Ben?!?!](http://wherethefuckisben.com/)
=====================

This is the base source code for wherethefuckisben.com,
which provides an early warning system to the people in the path of Taylorism [Taylorism](https://github.com/taybenlor).

If you're interested in custom Tayloring this worthy in-joke,
submit a pull request, then bug me to merge and Nick Cooper to update the domain itself.
